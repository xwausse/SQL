SELECT 
    year,
    (SELECT MAX(val) 
     FROM (VALUES (Max1), (Max2), (Max3)) AS ValueList(val)) AS MaxValue

 Separate uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters from a string ('tf56sd#%OqH')

 Evaluate math expressions in VARCHAR column (Equations table)
 SQL Server (only works with EXEC/sp_executesql via dynamic SQL):

SELECT equation,

       CAST(PARSENAME(REPLACE(equation, '+', '.'), 1) AS INT) AS Answer
FROM Equations
WHERE equation LIKE '%+%';
 MySQL 8.0+ (if string is like '3+2', '5*2'), no native support â€” requires UDF or client-side logic. You can parse basic math:
SELECT 
  equation,
  SUBSTRING_INDEX(equation, '+', 1) + SUBSTRING_INDEX(equation, '+', -1) AS answer
FROM Equations
WHERE equation LIKE '%+%';
 Find students with same birthday (Student Table)
