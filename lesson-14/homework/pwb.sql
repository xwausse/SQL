WHERE v.number BETWEEN 1 AND LEN(column_name);
6. Join p1 and p2, replace p1.code = 0
SELECT 
  p1.id,
  CASE WHEN p1.code = 0 THEN p2.code ELSE p1.code END AS code
FROM p1
JOIN p2 ON p1.id = p2.id;
7. Determine Employment Stage
Table: Employees
SELECT 
  EmployeeID,
  HIRE_DATE,
  CASE 
    WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, HIRE_DATE, GETDATE()) < 1 THEN 'New Hire'
    WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, HIRE_DATE, GETDATE()) < 6 THEN 'Junior'
    WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, HIRE_DATE, GETDATE()) < 11 THEN 'Mid-Level'
    WHEN DATEDIFF(YEAR, HIRE_DATE, GETDATE()) < 21 THEN 'Senior'
    ELSE 'Veteran'
  END AS EmploymentStage
FROM Employees;
8. Extract starting integer from string

  LEFT(Vals, PATINDEX('%[^0-9]%', Vals + 'X') - 1) AS StartInteger
FROM GetIntegers;
 Difficult Tasks

  FROM Activity
) a
WHERE rk = 1;

  SELECT 
    Area,
    DATEPART(WEEK, SaleDate) AS WeekNo,
    SUM(Amount) AS TotalSales
  FROM Sales
  GROUP BY Area, DATEPART(WEEK, SaleDate)
),
WeeklyTotal AS (
  SELECT
